## Approach:
### Responsive Design:
We used a mobile-first approach to responsive design, focusing on creating a seamless user experience across various devices. We utilized Bootstrap's mobile-first grid system and responsive utility classes to ensure optimal layout and styling.

### Grid System:
We used Bootstrap's grid system to create a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes. The grid system is based on a 12-column layout, with each column having a specific width and margin.

### Utility Classes:
We used Bootstrap's responsive utility classes to add responsive behavior to our layout. These classes allow us to easily add responsive behavior to our elements, such as hiding or showing elements on specific screen sizes.

### Media Queries:
We used media queries to apply different styles to our layout based on different screen sizes. Media queries allow us to define specific styles for specific screen sizes, ensuring that our layout looks great on all devices.
